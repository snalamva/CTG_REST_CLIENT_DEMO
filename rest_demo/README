These are sample programs to show REST WEBSERVICE DEMO using CTG and TXSeries,
To demo sample program use a TXSeries region named as RESTDEMO and use CICS Transaction
Gateway as client. The demo application shows a cheese store management using two CICS
appliactions which use DB2 as database. The applications provies two functionality,
1. Adding a new cheese details to Cheese Store 
2. Getting info on Cheese by passing cheese name as input.

Pre-requisites to run the application:
------------------------
   TXSeries V8.2 or higher versions
   CICS Transaction Gateway
   IBM DB2
   Xlc compiler on AIX
   Operating System: AIX

The script run.sh can be used to create all demo configuration. 
Before executing the script run.sh, make the following changes needed for demo.

1. Add following entry to /etc/services file to use the tcp/ip port for the demo

ipicdemo 55567/tcp    # Entry of IPIC listener on CICS region
ctgwd   55568/tcp       # Entry for CTG HTTP client for REST Clients to send requests
tcpdemo 55569/tcp       # Entry for TCP-IP Listener used for ECI clients" >> /etc/services

2. Change the DB2 DB details in the script in "region/compile_cics_programs.sh" script
  the below sections,
   
   DB2DB=cicstest
   DB2USR=cicstest
   DB2PWD=cicstest
   
3. Then run the script run.sh for configuration. "run.sh" script does the following things,
   (i)  Creates a CICS region named as RESTDEMO
   (ii) creates region configuration to start IPIC and TCPIP listener. TCPIP listner can be used
    to invoke backend CICS program using ECI clients and IPIC listener used to for webservice
    by CTG.
   (iii) Compile CICS backend program ADDC and GETC and adding the Program Definitions for the same.
   (iv)Create a new table named    as "cics.cheese" to store the cheese details
    (v)Generates CTG webservice artifacts and adds Web service entries to /opt/IBM/cicstg/bin/ctg.in file.
   
4. Append the content of file ctg_section.ini (after changing HOSTNAME) to /opt/IBM/cicstg/bin/ctg.ini file.

5. Start the CTG daemon using the below command

  # ctgstart



Usage of Demo from REST clients:
==========================
For testing the applications, you can use REST clients, Advance Rest Client (ARC) plugin added
on Chrome browser can be used for testing,

For testing ADDC backend CICS program using Advance Rest Client (ARC) follow the below steps:
-------
1.Use below URL for ADDC program,  and select "Method" as "POST",

http://HOSTNAME:55568//CHEESE/CHEESADD

2.Select Body content Type as "application/JSON"

3. Add the following JSON "Body" section as "Raw Input"

{"ADDCOperation":{"cheese":{"name":"MyTestCheese","supplier":"MyTestSupplier","supplier_address":"Addr_Bangalore","order_quantity":"100"}}}

4.The Input data can be edited by selecting "JSON visual editor", and click "SEND" button to pass the request to backend CICS
 program.

For testing GET backend CICS program using Advance Rest Client (ARC) follow the below steps:
-------
1.Use below URL for ADDC program,  and select "Method" as "POST",
http://HOSTNAME:55568//CHEESE/CHEESGET

2.Select Body content Type as "application/JSON"

3. Add the following JSON "Body" section as "Raw Input"

{"GETCOperation":{"cheese_req":{"name":"Stilton","supplier":"","supplier_address":"","order_quantity":""}}}

4.The Input data can be edited by selecting "JSON visual editor", and click "SEND" button to pass the request to backend CICS
 program.
